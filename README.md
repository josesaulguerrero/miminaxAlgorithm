# Minimax Algorithm 
I wrote this version of the minimax algorithm using typeScript, so that the code is much easier to read and understand for anyone who is interested or concerned about it.

## Getting started
If you want to try this algorithm and run it, then simply:
  1. Install all dependencies using `yarn install`.
  2. run `yarn start` on your terminal to build your files every time that the source code changes.
  3. Change the game board in the `board.ts` file.
  4. Finally, use `node` or `nodemon` to run the `bundle.js` file in the **dist** directory and see the results.
